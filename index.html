            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                The paper "Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation" by Kyunghyun Cho et al. proposes a novel approach to machine translation using a sequence-to-sequence model with an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) encoder-decoder architecture. The authors introduce the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) as a key component, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing and representing phrases in a source language for translation into a target language.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main idea revolves around the use of a neural network to encode an input sequence (source language) into a fixed-size vector representation, which is then decoded into the target sequence. This end-to-end learning approach allows the model to automatically learn complex mappings between source and target languages without the need for manual feature engineering or alignment.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                This question encompasses various aspects, including the exploration of more advanced architectures beyond RNNs, the investigation of attention mechanisms, and the development of models that can handle nuances, idioms, and cultural subtleties in translation.

        <h2>Proposed Architecture</h2>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="gru.png" alt="Gated Recurrent Unit" width="700">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to address the vanishing gradient problem in traditional RNNs. It consists of a set of recurrent units that maintain a hidden state and selectively update this state using gating mechanisms. The key components are the reset gate and update gate. The reset gate determines how much of the past information to forget, while the update gate controls how much of the new information to incorporate into the current hidden state. GRUs thus enable the model to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data by selectively updating and forgetting information, allowing for more effective learning and representation of temporal patterns. This architecture strikes a balance between the simplicity of traditional RNNs and the more complex Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, offering a computationally efficient solution for sequential data processing tasks.</p>
            <img src="gru_architecture.png" alt="RNN Encoder Decoder Architecture" width="500">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder-decoder architecture is a framework commonly used for sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation or text summarization. The encoder processes the input sequence step by step, producing a fixed-size context vector that captures the input sequence's information. Each step of the encoder involves updating its hidden state based on the input at that time step. Once the entire input sequence is encoded, the decoder generates the output sequence step by step, utilizing the context vector produced by the encoder. Similar to the encoder, the decoder maintains a hidden state that evolves with each generated output. At each time step, the decoder combines its current hidden state with the context vector to produce the output. This architecture enables the model to handle input and output sequences of varying lengths, making it versatile for tasks involving sequential data. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) are often used as building blocks for the encoder-decoder architecture to address vanishing gradient problems and capture long-range dependencies in the data.</p>
            <img src="gru_gates.png" alt="GRU Gates" width="500">
            <p></p><b>Equations:</b></p>

            <p>We start with calculating the update gate z_t for time step t using the formula:</p>
            <img src="gru_equation_6.png" alt="Update gate eq" width="500">
            <p>Update gate equation</p>
            <p>When x_t is plugged into the network unit, it is multiplied by its own weight W(z). The same goes for h_(t-1) which holds the information for the previous t-1 units and is multiplied by its own weight U(z). Both results are added together and a sigmoid activation function is applied to squash the result between 0 and 1.</p>
            <p>The update gate helps the model to determine how much of the past information (from previous time steps) needs to be passed along to the future. That is really powerful because the model can decide to copy all the information from the past and eliminate the risk of vanishing gradient problem. We will see the usage of the update gate later on. For now remember the formula for z_t.</p>

            <p>Essentially, this gate is used from the model to decide how much of the past information to forget. To calculate it, we use:</p>
            <img src="gru_equation_5.png" alt="Reset gate eq" width="500">
            <p>Reset gate equation</p>
            <p>This formula is the same as the one for the update gate. The difference comes in the weights and the usage of gate.</p>

            <p>Let us see how exactly the gates will affect the final output. First, we start with the usage of the reset gate. We introduce a new memory content which will use the reset gate to store the relevant information from the past. It is calculated as follows:</p>
            <img src="gru_equation_8.png" alt="New hidden state eq" width="500">
            <p>New hidden state equation</p>
            <p>Multiply the input x_t with a weight W and h_(t-1) with a weight U.</p>
            <p>Calculate the Hadamard (element-wise) product between the reset gate r_t and Uh_(t-1). That will determine what to remove from the previous time steps. Let us say we have a sentiment analysis problem for determining opinion of one about a book from a review he wrote. The text starts with This is a fantasy book which illustrates and after a couple paragraphs ends with I didn’t quite enjoy the book because I think it captures too many details. To determine the overall level of satisfaction from the book we only need the last part of the review. In that case as the neural network approaches to the end of the text it will learn to assign r_t vector close to 0, washing out the past and focusing only on the last sentences.</p>
            <p>Sum up the results of step 1 and 2.</p>
            <p>Apply the nonlinear activation function tanh.</p>

            <p>As the last step, the network needs to calculate h_t vector which holds information for the current unit and passes it down to the network. In order to do that the update gate is needed. It determines what to collect from the current memory content h_t and what from the previous steps h_(t-1). That is done as follows:</p>
            <img src="gru_equation_7.png" alt="Final hidden state eq" width="500">
            <p>Final hidden state equation</p>
            <p>Apply element-wise multiplication to the update gate z_t and h_(t-1).</p>
            <p>Apply element-wise multiplication to (1-z_t) and h_t.</p>
            <p>Sum the results from step 1 and 2.</p>
            <p>
                Let us bring up the example about the book review. This time, the most relevant information is positioned in the beginning of the text. The model can learn to set the vector z_t close to 1 and keep a majority of the previous information. Since z_t will be close to 1 at this time step, 1-z_t will be close to 0 which will ignore big portion of the current content (in this case the last part of the review which explains the book plot) which is irrelevant for our prediction.
            </p>
            <p>Now, you can see how GRUs are able to store and filter the information using their update and reset gates. That eliminates the vanishing gradient problem since the model is not washing out the new input every single time but keeps the relevant information and passes it down to the next time steps of the network. If carefully trained, they can perform extremely well even in complex scenarios.</p>

        <h2>Experiments</h2>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
            <p>
                WMT 2014 is a workshop of statistical machine translation; it has a collection of datasets. The authors use english-french dataset for translation tasks.
                The baseline phrase-based SMT system was built using Moses software with its default settings and the BLEU scores were calculated. The Bilingual Evaluation Understudy Score, or BLEU for short, is a metric for evaluating a generated sentence to a reference sentence. A perfect match results in a score of 1, whereas a perfect mismatch results in a score of 0. Scores greater than 1 usually mean a better match.
            </p>
            <p>
                The proposed <b>RNN Encoder-Decoder</b> model has 1000 hidden units with the update and reset gates in the encoder and decoder.
                A rank-100 matrix, equivalent to learning an embedding of dimension 100 for each word was used. The activation function used for h in Eq. (8) is a hyperbolic tangent function.
                All the weight parameters were initialized by sampling from an isotropic zero-mean Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 0.01, except for the recurrent weight parameters. For the recurrent weight matrices, they sampled from a white Gaussian distribution and used its left singular vectors matrix.
            </p>
            <p>
                During training this RNN, frequency of phrase pairs are ignored in order to promote learning of linguistic regularities. Due to this, the model is expected to
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        reduce the computational expense of randomly selecting phrase pairs from a large phrase table according to the normalized frequencies
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ensure that the RNN Encoder-Decoder does not simply learn to rank the phrase pairs according to their numbers of occurrences
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="gru_sentences.png" alt="bleu scores" width="800">
                <p>
                    The table above shows the samples generated from the RNN Encoder–Decoder for each source phrase sorted by the scores.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                To assess the performance of the proposed architecture, the authors also trained a more traditional <b>CSLM</b> (continuous space language model) on 7-grams. By doing this, they aimed to clarify whether the contributions from multiple neural networks in different parts of the SMT system add up or are redundant.
                CSLM captures the frequency of the words as well while the RNN encoder-decoder model mainly learns linguistic characteristics.
                <br>As shown in the table we see an improvement when the RNN model and CSLM model are both used; suggesting contributions from both models are not correlated.

                <br>
                Penalizing the unknown words using <b>word penalty (WP)</b> in the final model does not improve performance on test data as shown in the table above.
            </p>
            <p>
                The RNN Encoder-Decoder projects a sequence of words to and from a continuous vector space. Word and phrase representations are plotted to understand if the model is learning semantically and syntactically.

        <h2>Social Impact</h2>
        <p align="justify">
            GRU have led to innovative solutions in fields of finance, social media etc. Based on the application,
            the impact of the GRU models vary and therefore certain generalized measures to avoid negative impacts have to be developed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
            One of the prominent use cases for gate recurrent units has been sentiment analysis on social media platforms.
            From that perspective, GRU is used to understand user emotions, for marketing and public opinion monitoring.
            <b>GRUs applied to analyze human behavior data raise concerns about privacy and data breaches.</b>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
            Individuals' are subject to increased surveillance and monitoring leading to privacy concerns and in case of a data breach can compromise individuals' sensitive information.
            It is therefore of high importance to define <b>comprehensive ethical guidelines</b> addressing issues such as <b>bias, privacy, and transparency</b>.
            Standards for <b>anonymization of data</b> used in GRU training must be developed in order to reduce the risk of re-identification of individuals.

        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            The paper was presented at the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), and had a significant impact on the field of machine translation and natural language processing. The introduction of the sequence-to-sequence model with an RNN encoder-decoder architecture, particularly using the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), had several industrial implications:
        </p>
        <ol style="text-align: justify;">
            <li>
                <b>Improved Machine Translation Performance:</b>
                <br>The paper demonstrated that the proposed RNN-based sequence-to-sequence model outperformed existing statistical machine translation systems. It showcased improved translation quality, especially for capturing long-range dependencies in sentences.</ br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>End-to-End Learning:</b>
                <br>The sequence-to-sequence model allowed for end-to-end learning, meaning that the entire translation process, from input to output, could be learned jointly.

                <br>RNNs, especially the GRU variant introduced in the paper, proved effective in handling variable-length input and output sequences. This flexibility was crucial for processing sentences of different lengths in machine translation, allowing for more accurate and context-aware translations.</ br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Wider Adoption of Neural Networks in Machine Translation:</b>
                <br>The success of the sequence-to-sequence model in the paper contributed to the broader adoption of neural network architectures in machine translation systems. Neural machine translation (NMT) models, building on the principles introduced in this paper, became the state-of-the-art approach in the years that followed.</ br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Influence on Research Directions:</b>
                <br>The paper influenced subsequent research in neural machine translation and related fields. Researchers started exploring variations of the encoder-decoder architecture, experimenting with different recurrent units, attention mechanisms, and optimization techniques.</ br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Transition from Phrase-Based to Neural Machine Translation:</b>
                <br>The paper played a role in the transition from traditional phrase-based machine translation systems to neural machine translation systems. The latter became the dominant approach due to their ability to capture semantic relationships and context more effectively.</ br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Open Source Implementations and Frameworks:</b>
                <br>The release of open-source implementations of the sequence-to-sequence model, often based on the findings in the paper, facilitated its practical application. This led to the development of machine translation systems using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.</ br>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In summary, the paper had a profound impact on the industrial landscape of machine translation, influencing the adoption of neural network-based approaches and paving the way for advancements in natural language processing tasks beyond translation. The principles introduced in this paper continue to shape the development of state-of-the-art models in various language-related applications.</p>
