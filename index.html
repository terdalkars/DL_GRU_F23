            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                The paper "Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation" by Kyunghyun Cho et al. proposes a novel approach to machine translation using a sequence-to-sequence model with an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) encoder-decoder architecture. The authors introduce the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) as a key component, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing and representing phrases in a source language for translation into a target language.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main idea revolves around the use of a neural network to encode an input sequence (source language) into a fixed-size vector representation, which is then decoded into the target sequence. This end-to-end learning approach allows the model to automatically learn complex mappings between source and target languages without the need for manual feature engineering or alignment.
            </p>

        <h2>Proposed Architecture</h2>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="gru.png" alt="Gated Recurrent Unit" width="700">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to address the vanishing gradient problem in traditional RNNs. It consists of a set of recurrent units that maintain a hidden state and selectively update this state using gating mechanisms. The key components are the reset gate and update gate. The reset gate determines how much of the past information to forget, while the update gate controls how much of the new information to incorporate into the current hidden state. GRUs thus enable the model to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data by selectively updating and forgetting information, allowing for more effective learning and representation of temporal patterns. This architecture strikes a balance between the simplicity of traditional RNNs and the more complex Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, offering a computationally efficient solution for sequential data processing tasks.</p>
            <img src="gru_architecture.png" alt="RNN Encoder Decoder Architecture" width="500">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder-decoder architecture is a framework commonly used for sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation or text summarization. The encoder processes the input sequence step by step, producing a fixed-size context vector that captures the input sequence's information. Each step of the encoder involves updating its hidden state based on the input at that time step. Once the entire input sequence is encoded, the decoder generates the output sequence step by step, utilizing the context vector produced by the encoder. Similar to the encoder, the decoder maintains a hidden state that evolves with each generated output. At each time step, the decoder combines its current hidden state with the context vector to produce the output. This architecture enables the model to handle input and output sequences of varying lengths, making it versatile for tasks involving sequential data. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) are often used as building blocks for the encoder-decoder architecture to address vanishing gradient problems and capture long-range dependencies in the data.</p>

            <p>Here, $$ 𝑥_t $$ is the input at time step 𝑡, $$ 𝒉_{t-1} $$ is the hidden state from the previous time step, 𝑊 and 𝒃 are weight matrices and bias vectors, respectively, and σ is the sigmoid activation function.</p>
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>Let's consider a simple example of a GRU with a one-dimensional input (𝑥_t) and a hidden state (𝒉_t). Assume that the input size is 4, and the hidden state size is 3.</p>
            <p>
                // Example Equations
                $$ r_t = σ(W_{ir}x_t + W_{hr}h_{t-1})$$
                $$ z_t = σ(W_{iz}x_t + W_{hz}h_{t-1})$$
                $$ 𝜏h_t = tanh(W_{ic}x_t + r_t ⋅ (W_{hc}h_{t-1}))$$
                $$ h_t = (1 - z_t) ⋅ h_{t-1} + z_t ⋅ 𝜏h_t$$
            </p>
            <p>In this example, the weight matrices 𝑊 and bias vectors 𝒃 are parameters that the model learns during training. The reset gate 𝑟_t determines how much of the previous hidden state to forget, the update gate 𝑧_t controls the information flow from the current input, and the candidate hidden state 𝜏h_t captures the new information to be added to the hidden state. The final hidden state 𝒉_t is a combination of the previous state and the new information, controlled by the update gate.</p>

        <h2>Experiments</h2>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
            <p>
                WMT 2014 is a workshop of statistical machine translation; it has a collection of datasets. The authors use english-french dataset for translation tasks.
                The baseline phrase-based SMT system was built using Moses software with its default settings and the BLEU scores were calculated. The Bilingual Evaluation Understudy Score, or BLEU for short, is a metric for evaluating a generated sentence to a reference sentence. A perfect match results in a score of 1, whereas a perfect mismatch results in a score of 0. Scores greater than 1 usually mean a better match.
            </p>
            <p>
                The proposed <b>RNN Encoder-Decoder</b> model has 1000 hidden units with the update and reset gates in the encoder and decoder.
                A rank-100 matrix, equivalent to learning an embedding of dimension 100 for each word was used. The activation function used for h in Eq. (8) is a hyperbolic tangent function.
                All the weight parameters were initialized by sampling from an isotropic zero-mean Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 0.01, except for the recurrent weight parameters. For the recurrent weight matrices, they sampled from a white Gaussian distribution and used its left singular vectors matrix.
            </p>
            <p>
                During training this RNN, frequency of phrase pairs are ignored in order to promote learning of linguistic regularities. Due to this, the model is expected to
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        reduce the computational expense of randomly selecting phrase pairs from a large phrase table according to the normalized frequencies
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ensure that the RNN Encoder-Decoder does not simply learn to rank the phrase pairs according to their numbers of occurrences
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="gru_sentences.png" alt="bleu scores" width="800">
                <p>
                    The table above shows the samples generated from the RNN Encoder–Decoder for each source phrase sorted by the scores.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                To assess the performance of the proposed architecture, the authors also trained a more traditional <b>CSLM</b> (continuous space language model) on 7-grams. By doing this, they aimed to clarify whether the contributions from multiple neural networks in different parts of the SMT system add up or are redundant.
                CSLM captures the frequency of the words as well while the RNN encoder-decoder model mainly learns linguistic characteristics.
                <br>As shown in the table we see an improvement when the RNN model and CSLM model are both used; suggesting contributions from both models are not correlated.

        <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="gru_blue_scores.png" alt="bleu scores" width="300"></div>

        <div style="text-align: justify;">
            <p>
                <br>
                Penalizing the unknown words using <b>word penalty (WP)</b> in the final model does not improve performance on test data as shown in the table above.
            </p>
            <p>
                The RNN Encoder-Decoder projects a sequence of words to and from a continuous vector space. Word and phrase representations are plotted to understand if the model is learning semantically and syntactically.
            </p>

            <p>
                The bottom plot shows the 2d word embeddings learnt by the RNN model; clear clusters of semantically similar words are observed.

                Similarly for phrases, both semantic and syntactic structures are captured. Both red and pink colour-coded plots at the bottom show semantically similar phrases related to time and countries respectively while the plot on the top right blue colour-coded shows syntactically similar phrases.

                <br>RNNs, especially the GRU variant introduced in the paper, proved effective in handling variable-length input and output sequences. This flexibility was crucial for processing sentences of different lengths in machine translation, allowing for more accurate and context-aware translations.</ br>
            </li>
            <li>

            <li>
                <b>Transition from Phrase-Based to Neural Machine Translation:</b>
                <br>The paper played a role in the transition from traditional phrase-based machine translation systems to neural machine translation systems. The latter became the dominant approach due to their ability to capture semantic relationships and context more effectively.</ br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Open Source Implementations and Frameworks:</b>
                <br>The release of open-source implementations of the sequence-to-sequence model, often based on the findings in the paper, facilitated its practical application. This led to the development of machine translation systems using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.</ br>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In summary, the paper had a profound impact on the industrial landscape of machine translation, influencing the adoption of neural network-based approaches and paving the way for advancements in natural language processing tasks beyond translation. The principles introduced in this paper continue to shape the development of state-of-the-art models in various language-related applications.</p>
